1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?

We're working with them as a research, professional development and curriculum partner, and I've heard nothing but rave reviews.

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?

I hoe to resharpen my coding skills, which are HTML-era and RUSTY. Time to come into this century fully!
