1. Why have you decided to learn Git and GitHub?

We're working with them as a research, professional development and curriculum partner, and I've heard nothing but rave reviews.

2. How do you plan to use GitHub in your classroom?

I hope to resharpen my coding skills, which are HTML-era and RUSTY. Time to come into this century fully!\

3. What are ways that GitHub might help you and your students manage code?

The ability to branch and resolve branches, work separately but parallel.
